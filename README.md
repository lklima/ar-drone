Set up the development environment for [react native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). 

> ⚠️ NOTE: The android emulators are not supported by Viro. See [this](https://viro-community.readme.io/docs/frequently-asked-questions#does-this-work-with-ios-simulators-or-android-emulators).

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/ViroCommunity/starter-kit.git`
2. `cd starter-kit`
3. `npm install`
4. `npx pod-install` (iOS)
5. `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`
